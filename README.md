Field Phenotyping Application to Improve Data Collection. 
Our team is developing a field phenotyping application designed to standardize the phenotypic data collection of sorghum and other crops. This mobile application is built with a web-based framework called React Native, which is an open-source framework developed by Facebook for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. Using React Native enables our application to operate across multiple operating systems (iOS/Android) and devices (phones/tablets)(Figure 5). Our developers will utilize MongoDB for database storage and leverage AWS cloud services to ensure scalable, reliable, and secure data management.  This mobile application will be designed to assist in collecting all phenotypic measurements associated with sorghum and other crops, such as height, tiller count, stand count, lodging percentage, and multiple other data points. Utilizing a digital platform will offer numerous advantages over traditional manual data collection methods, eliminating the need for physical tools such as paper and pen.  This will thereby reduce the risk of data loss or damage and enhance overall efficiency in the data collection process. This app will allow for seamless, real-time data aggregation, ensuring that all collected information is stored in a centralized location. This will mitigate the challenges associated with consolidating data from multiple sources into a single document. Furthermore, the app will enhance data accuracy and consistency, reducing human error, and facilitating more efficient data analysis and sharing among researchers and stakeholders. Our goal is to modernize and streamline the data collection process, leading to more reliable and actionable insights for advancing agricultural phenotyping practices.  Future versions of the phenotyping app will incorporate technologies such as smart glasses for remote phenotyping, live video streaming, and height measuring. This will create a symbiotic relationship between the app and smart glasses for enhanced data collection and analysis.
